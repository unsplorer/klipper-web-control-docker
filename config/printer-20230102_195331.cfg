# [include mainsail.cfg]
# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3
# Pro with the 32-bit Creality 4.2.2 board. To use this config, during
# "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and
# serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.

# It should be noted that newer variations of this printer shipping in
# 2022 may have GD32F103 chips installed and not STM32F103. You may
# have to inspect the mainboard to ascertain which one you have. If it
# is the GD32F103 then please select Disable SWD at startup in the
# "make menuconfig" along with the same settings for STM32F103.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select
# serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10), which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC
# cable used for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

retract_length: 1.2
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
retract_speed: 20
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.
